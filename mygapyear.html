                        <h2>My gap year: <br>Placement at HSBC</h2>

                <p>I spent 10 months as an Industrial Placement Trainee at HSBC. I was assigned to the EPS IT team under the Online Banking System department, where I was trained to solve numbers of IT problems and obtained a thorough appreciation of how technology could contribute to a bank system. Hong Kong is well-known for its banking business. Before I joined HSBC, I have been always curious about what it would be like to work in a bank as an engineer. Working in the EPS team was the best way for me to explore this industry and gave me opportunities to improve my professional and personal skills. </p>
                <p>EPS is a cash-less payment system provides merchants with a risk-free and efficient way of settling transaction. Transaction is the theme of my job in the team. In order to make sure the bank cards from a wide range of banks can support the EPS transaction, I was mainly responsible for the card testing on the POS terminals as well as on the simulator which simulates the transaction process on the computer. I have to cooperate and communicate with different people such as card data provider and IT of bank to ensure a successful testing. Sometimes the transaction would be rejected due to various reasons involves network layer problem, which would cause the communication time out, and the wrong data of the card, which would cause the verification failed. Solving those problems really improved my problem-solving skills and interpersonal skills, and in turns let me understand more about this system.</p>
                <img class="image fit" src="images/gapyear/simulator.JPG" alt="" />
                
                <p>My first project in the EPS team was pure cash back project. Pure cash back allows users to withdraw cashes without buying anything in the convenience store Circle K. My job was to change the program for generating transaction reports to support the pure cash back details by using JCL and COBOL. JCL and COBOL are the languages that I never used and even never heard before. At that time, I only got 3 weeks to finish the coding and testing and I had to learn really fast and independently to use these two languages. Although I felt great pressure, I still completed my codes on time and successfully finished the health check of my program. Now the pure cash back was successfully launched in Hong Kong and I was really proud of what I have done in this project. Meanwhile, I was really thankful because this experience pushed me to learn the JCL and COBOL languages and improved my anti-pressure abilities.</p>
                
                <p>This placement is definitely unforgettable because there were many “first times” of my life happened during my work. I first time developed a VBA program to help generating testing cases for PPS bill payment testing. I first time deployed a server and used Linux command to operate the server. I first time had a business trip to HKT alone for the dialling connection test. First time trying would always be difficult and I was glad that I dared to move out of my comfort zone and overcame those challenges in my job.</p>
                <p>What I think this placement benefitted me most was the improvement of my interpersonal skills. Before I joined the HSBC, I was afraid that I would not communicate well with my colleagues because of my poor Cantonese. However, it turned out that they didn’t mind about it and I could even make friends with them. We had lunch together every day and we developed good relationship with each other. Meanwhile, the team meeting every two weeks was also a perfect opportunity for me to study Cantonese. As a result, my Cantonese improved quickly and now I can express my ideas to my colleagues in Cantonese accurately and efficiently.</p>
                
                <p>During my placement at HSBC, I have experienced the challenges of a technology-driven business environment, contributing to meaningful projects that have a direct impact on the business success. I have gained an understanding of the role of technology in a leading global bank and developed strong foundation of technical knowledge. I believe these experiences and skills would benefit me to achieve a successful career and life in the soon future.</p>
